Provides a way to track missing achievements. 


Users will be able to enter achievements that they're missing in games they're playing. The app will keep track of the achievement, what is needed to finish it, and what game it belongs to. 

this project needs to be fleshed out and planned. 
I will actually sit down and flesh out this project tomorrow.
